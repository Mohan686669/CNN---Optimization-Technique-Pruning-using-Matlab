CNN - Network Pruning

This (.mat) file has the code of CNN Optimization technique such as pruning which i have tried during my final year project.
While performing this operation, my primary ajenda was to achieve high accuracy after performing optimation. (for this operation i have used the smallest CNN Lenet-5)

Instructions to compare the optimization:
1. First open the Matlab Deeplearning Toolbox, where you have construct your cnn, i have used LeNet-5, as per the image.
2. To import the file use the code from import.mat.txt file.
3. The code is specifically for LeNet-5, for you to use it for other CNN's you need to modify the layers according to the network which you are using in the code.
4. Inorder to compare the accuracy results from, before pruning, after pruning, before finetuning and after finetuning, try to comment the rest of the code and try to use the pruned network to get the better output.
